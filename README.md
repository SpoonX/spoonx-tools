This module basically just bundles all the packages, needed to build an aurelia plugin, into a single repo. No need to update all repositories of your aurelia-plugins once a build tool changes. Spoonx-tools is the only devDependency and updating that will do that for you.

The options for spoonx-tools can be set in `spoonx.js`. There are some other files needed to get started with writing your plugin. Best is, to just clone the [aurelia-plugin-skeleton](https://github.com/SpoonX/aurelia-plugin-skeleton), and start from there.

## Features
- contains all gulp tasks needed to build your plugin
- contains a karma testing setup
- sensible eslint rules
- all settings combined in `spoonx.js`

## Doumentation
